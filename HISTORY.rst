Changes
-------

* v0.1.4a:
  
  - Update build/PyPI info: move to Stable, add Python 3.4 version.
  - Fix a few README RST issues.

* v0.1.3:

  - Add ``receivables`` manager to the API. This manager allows you to
    build a list similar to the *Outstanding Receivables* page of
    *Financial Reporting*.
  - Add ``api.invoices.map_exact2foreign_invoice_numbers`` and
    ``api.invoices.map_foreign2exact_invoice_numbers`` methods to
    quickly get a mapping between our own and the ExactOnline invoice
    numbers.
  - Python3 compatibility.
  - Minor fixes.
